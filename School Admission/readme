Using gradient descent to train a network on graduate school admissions data (found at http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/data/binary.csv. 
This dataset has three input features: GRE score, GPA, and the rank of the undergraduate school (numbered 1 through 4).
Institutions with rank 1 have the highest prestige, those with rank 4 have the lowest.
The goal here is to predict if a student will be admitted to a graduate program based on these features. For this, we'll use a network with one output layer with one unit. We'll use a sigmoid function for the output unit activation.
